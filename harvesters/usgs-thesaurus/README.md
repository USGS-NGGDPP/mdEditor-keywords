# USGS Thesaurus Harvester

**DEPRECATED**

This is an old version of the USGS Thesaurus harvester. It was designed only for the thesaurus and not any of the other resources which could be retrieved using the API.
This first version focused on the sql dump and parsing that, but the API is actually sufficient for retrieving this data so a new USGS harvester has been developed that can
still support this thesaurus, but it can also support all the other USGS vocabularies.

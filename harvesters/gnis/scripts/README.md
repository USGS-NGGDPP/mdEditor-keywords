# scripts

These files are additional scripts that produce metadata about the files in the data directory. They will not be documented other than to say they can provide information about features broken up by state as well as some additional metadata. To use them, they should be able to run as long as you have the correct files, just save the original `domesticNames.js` file in the parent directory to this one, then move whichever script you want to use and rename it to remove the \_Scratch appended to the end.
